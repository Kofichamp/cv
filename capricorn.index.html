      <p>The last earth sign of the zodiac, Capricorns and their unique spirits are powerful, to say the least.</p>
      <p> I've worked with thousands of clients over my nearly-10 year-long career as a professional astrologer, and I can confirm that there's something that makes Capricorn extremely special.</p>                              
      <p>Perhaps it's their fearless ambition? Their limitless resilience? Their ability to keep pushing forward, even in the face of challenging adversity and painful strife? Or, maybe it's their secret wild side that's very rarely depicted in standard personality assessments, but that rumbles within the soul of every Capricorn: Not everyone gets to see Capricorn ordering rounds of tequila, dancing on the table, and staying out until the crack of dawn â€” but that rebellious, untamed spirit is a Capricorn asset.</p>
         <p> I mean, how else do you expect this zodiac sign to let loose and have fun?</p>
