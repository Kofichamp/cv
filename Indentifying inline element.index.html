<h2><b>Low and Slow</b></h>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide.</em> <dfn>In <em>sous vide</em> cooking,</dfn> you submerge the food<small>(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</small> into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked. In this book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <em>sous vide</em> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time>November 30.</time></P>
